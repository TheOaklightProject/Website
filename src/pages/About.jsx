          <h2>Our Story</h2>
          <p>
            The Oaklight Project began as a vision among high school student friends who 
            wanted to create something special for their community. We saw an opportunity 
            to organize unique and exciting activities that would bring people together 
            in meaningful ways.
          </p>
          <p>
            What started as a simple idea has grown into a movement focused on creating 
            memorable experiences for the people of Oakdale. We believe in the power of 
            community and the impact that well-organized events can have on bringing 
            people closer together.
